According to the juicy insights from the context, people aren’t just using AI as a fancy tool to punch in tasks—they're leveraging ChatGPT as a **decision-making sidekick and research advisor** in the workplace. It’s like having the smartest partner who boosts your brain’s horsepower, especially in knowledge-dense gigs where every choice counts.\\n\\nSo instead of AI just clocking boring tasks, it’s **amplifying worker output by supercharging the quality of their decisions**—making them sharper, faster, and maybe even a bit more legendary at what they do. This elevated decision support translates to better productivity and, bam, more money moves.\\n\\nPlus, the sheer value is colossal: Collis and Brynjolfsson (2025) drop this beast of a stat—US users would need a $98 monthly payout just to skip using AI, reflecting a mind-boggling **$97 billion per year surplus**. That’s AI turning into a goldmine not by replacing jobs but by **helping humans crush their work smarter**.\\n\\nIn short: the money magic happens when AI gets into your corner as an advisor and research partner, elevating your work game rather than just automating the grunt work. Productivity and paychecks get a turbo boost through smarter decisions powered by generative AI.\\n\\n**That’s how people are cashing in on AI’s rad powers—by turning it into the ultimate workplace wingman.** Mic drop.\""

        "The larger embedding model and larger chunks certainly helped chain 2 to achieve higher levels of correctness and helpfulness because it likely gained a better understanding of the meaning and intent in the reference text, and of the user's question. The larger embedding model generates more precise vector embeddings, that allow the question and the reference text to have cosine similarities that are more in line with reality. That sets the base for model to perform a more accurate search for an answer."
